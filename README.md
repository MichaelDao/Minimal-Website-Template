# Just change the name, avatar, and the links
A quick, minimal personal website I built from scratch with SASS and Compass, feel free to fork it for yourself!

If you want to edit the stylesheet without SASS, just edit style.css in the stylesheets folder.

But all you really need to do for yourself is to edit the content in index.html.
